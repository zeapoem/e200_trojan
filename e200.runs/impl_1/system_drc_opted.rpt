BIVC-1#1 Error
Bank IO standard Vcc  - IOBank:13
Conflicting Vcc voltages in bank 13. For example, the following two ports in this bank have conflicting VCCOs:  
ck_io[0] (LVCMOS18, requiring VCCO=1.800) and CLK100MHZ (LVCMOS33, requiring VCCO=3.300)
Related violations: <none>

PLCK-87#1 Error
Clock Placer Checks  
IO/clock placer failed to collectively place all IOs and clock instances. This is likely due to design requirements or user constraints specified in the constraint file such as IO standards, bank/voltage/DCI/VREF specifications, together with the part and package being used for the implementation. Please check the above for any possible conflicts.

Related violations: <none>

NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
48 out of 57 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: ck_io[19:0], qspi_dq[3:0], ck_miso, ck_mosi, ck_rst, ck_sck, ck_ss, ja_0, ja_1, jd_0, jd_2, jd_4, jd_5, led0_b, led0_g (the first 15 of 26 listed).
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
24 out of 57 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: ck_miso, ck_mosi, ck_rst, ck_sck, ck_ss, ja_0, ja_1, jd_0, jd_2, jd_4, jd_5, led0_b, led0_g, led0_r, led1_b (the first 15 of 24 listed).
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer IOBUF_gpio_16/IBUF (in IOBUF_gpio_16 macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#2 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer IOBUF_jtag_TDO/IBUF (in IOBUF_jtag_TDO macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>
